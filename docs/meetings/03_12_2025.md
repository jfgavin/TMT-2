## Notes
- Consider 10 inputs from TMT 1.0
- Consider lifespan
	- Agent leak
	- Don't have deterministic a lifespan cap
	- Agents should become less productive, and elect to self terminate when they are not contributing to the society
	- Rather than becoming unable to produce new agents, perhaps the agents they produce should become less productive. We should aim to not produce unproductive agents.
- Consider how real human psychology could lead to the two archetypes above (Tolerant, Intolerant)
