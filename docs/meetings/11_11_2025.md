## Aim

To establish project timeline and top-level approach of technical implementation.

### Old Code
- Get old code from Matt
- First get running
- Look at movement mechanics
- Look at clustering and observe changes through adjustment of clusters $k$
- Consider what migrates as "code", "idea" or otherwise

### New Model
- Consider dilemma in agent self-sacrifice
- Consider seasonal resources
- Look at making model more adaptable and "organic"
- Resources are produced by agent action, not arbitrarily introduced
    - Older agents become less productive with age

### Agent Reproduction
- Consider reproduction maturity e.g. 20-40 age
- Rather than tuning respawn-rate, tune probability of two agents reproducing
- Equilibrium is where old-age mortality rate == birth rate

### TMT 2.0
- Anxiety buffering should be more "organic"
    - Consider perceptrons

- Form opinions regarding self sacrifice
    - Attachment types could influence these opinions and hence outcomes

- Look at how attachment types impacted movement, and consider how they should impact other factors in the society
